    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rethinking Autonomy in Psychiatry Using the Social Model of Disability</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Autonomy is a fundamental concept in psychiatry, shaping how we understand individual agency and decision-making in a medical context. Bergamin et al. explores the subject in 
      <i>Defining Autonomy in Psychiatry</i>. His key claim is, &ldquo;mental illness interferes with the set of capacities required for autonomy. (Bergamin, p.2, 2022)&rdquo; 
      Bergamin oversimplifies autonomy by looking at prototypical disorder examples, which leave room for medical overreach. This paper argues for a more nuanced approach that integrates the social model of disability, further shifting the burden of proof from the patient to the medical practitioner when assessing autonomy and capacity. We will reconstruct Bergamin&rsquo;s argument, critique its oversight, and propose an alternative framework.</p><br>
      <span id="dots2"></span>
      <div id="more2">
        <p>The two main capacities that Bergamin argues are needed for autonomy are competence (the ability to form goals, make decisions, and act on them) and authenticity (alignment between one&rsquo;s actions and true values). He then uses prototypical conditions defined in the DSM-5 (e.g., depression, schizophrenia, OCD) and shows how each impairs either autonomy or competence in distinct ways. For instance, OCD impairs authenticity, where someone cleans for hours, knowing it's pointless but unable to stop. This same line of argument could be used when talking about addiction, where in some cases an addict will recognize and want to stop their addiction but be unable to. Another example brought up in the paper is Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a condition that may lead to, among other things, a feeling of learned helplessness, in which a person believes that they cannot control their circumstances. Learned helplessness would be an example of an impairment to autonomy. Bergamin argues that both impairments to autonomy and authenticity justify intervention, and severe mental illnesses usually justify paternalistic treatments.</p><br>
        <p>I agree with many of the arguments Bergamin presents, particularly the importance of an evidence-based approach in assessing autonomy. It is common sense that interventions are sometimes necessary, such as in cases where individuals are at risk of self-harm. Many people lose their lives without seeking help, and conditions the Bergamin brings up, like substance use disorder or anorexia nervosa, often require external intervention to initiate and complete treatment. However, my critique is that the paper does not adequately consider the risks of medical overreach. By relying on prototypical examples, Bergamin creates a reductive and potentially harmful narrative about mental illness and autonomy.&nbsp;</p><br>
        <p>The DSM-5 also exemplifies an approach to psychology sometimes referred to as the medical model of disability, in which conditions are primarily viewed as individual impairments requiring diagnosis and treatment, rather than considering the broader ways society can disable an individual with a disability. The social model views disability as an interaction between individuals and their environment, not an inherent deficiency. The American Psychological Association describes this model as recognizing that "disability is seen as one aspect of a person&rsquo;s identity, much like race/ethnicity, gender, etc. From this perspective, disability is believed to result from a mismatch between the disabled person and the environment [...] where negative stereotypes, discrimination, and oppression serve as barriers to environmental change and full inclusion. (Olkin, 2022)," This challenges the idea that mental illness inherently compromises autonomy and questions legal or medical systems that strip rights based on assumed incapacity.</p><br>
        <p>There are several situations Bergamin could have explored to better illustrate the potential for medical overreach. One prominent example is conservatorship, which, while intended as a safeguard for individuals deemed incapable of making decisions for themselves, often serves as a tool for medical overreach, stripping people of their autonomy under the guise of protection. Britney Spears' highly publicized legal battle brought national attention to the dangers of conservatorship, particularly in its ability to deny individuals fundamental rights. Many believed it was unjust that bad-faith actors were able to manipulate perceptions of Spears&rsquo;s mental capacity, leveraging her mental health history to justify extreme restrictions (Day and Herstik). An article by the ACLU highlights Spears' case as part of a broader historical pattern in which people with disabilities (especially black and/or female disabled people) have been forcibly sterilized, denied freedom of movement or finances, or prevented from making choices because they were deemed incapable. Courts often justify these decisions as being in individuals' "best interest," yet they are frequently rooted in stigma and paternalism rather than a genuine assessment of capacity. Spears' case represents just one example among over a million Americans under conservatorship who may face similar restrictions (Brennan-Krohn, 2021). The controversy surrounding her legal battle underscores the need for reforms that prioritize autonomy and recognize alternative, less restrictive support systems, such as supported decision-making.</p><br>
        <p>Bergamin partially acknowledges medical overreach in his article, stating in his clinical implications section that some cases ultimately depend on environmental and circumstantial factors. Just because he mentions how social context affects autonomy, does not mean he is using the social model of disability. Bergamin largely overlooks the interplay that makes autonomy in psychiatry so challenging. For instance, the controversy surrounding involuntary commitment laws for people who commit violent crimes while experiencing mental illness highlights this tension. Advocates argue that agency and autonomy are crucial to recovery, while supporters of mandatory commitment claim it is necessary to reduce recidivism (The Alliance for Rights and Recovery, p.1). On a similar note, recent arguments advocating for institutionalizing homeless people with severe mental illness often frame autonomy as secondary to public safety and the well-being of non-disabled people. As a 2023 <i>Los Angeles Times</i> article by Laura Newberry highlights, this approach fails to address the root causes of homelessness (which Newberry identified as a lack of affordable housing and social support) while potentially infringing on individual rights (Newberry). The tendency to medicalize homelessness and prioritize forced institutionalization over systemic reform reflects the medical model of disability. It also underscores the wider point I am trying to make involving the balance between autonomy and care, and the risk of using medical authority to justify coercion. Thus, a more effective approach might involve expanding voluntary support systems rather than reinforcing paternalistic policies that may do more harm than good.</p><br>
        <p>One could argue that intervention might be needed to restore greater autonomy. This is an argument Bergmin brings up several times in his article. A homeless person suffering from schizophrenia for instance may appreciate the forced institutionalization, if he were not suffering from schizophrenia. Then a fair argument could be made for the policy if you proved its efficacy. This also brings up an issue with the social model of disability that does not work in cases like psychosis, or other hard line medical conditions, where it would be hard to argue the greatest debilitating factor is social as opposed to medical.&nbsp;</p><br>
        <p>My counter argument would be that the article&rsquo;s framing around the medical model ignores some of the nuance the social model could offer. In Bergamin&rsquo;s article, each example is oriented around how someone's internal impairment would inherently infringe on competence or authenticity. With this framing, the burden of proof is on the patient. Additionally, Bergamin&rsquo;s definition of authenticity as the alignment between one&rsquo;s actions and true values raises critical concerns about who determines whether an action is authentic. If a person with OCD feels distress when they don&rsquo;t perform a ritual, is their behavior truly inauthentic, or is it only considered so because it deviates from neurotypical expectations? Similarly, if mental health professionals or legal authorities decide what counts as &ldquo;true values,&rdquo; there is a risk of imposing socially constructed definitions of rationality or well-being. Historically, this has led to the pathologization of marginalized identities (e.g., homosexuality was once classified as a disorder in the DSM).&nbsp;</p><br>
        <p>If we oriented Bergamins article around the social model of disability it would shift the burden of proof to the psychologist. Consider how social and environmental factors shape a psychologist's perception of autonomy or impairment. This challenges Bergamin&rsquo;s justification for paternalistic interventions, especially in cases where the "impairment" is more about societal intolerance than an individual&rsquo;s actual incapacity, while also leaving space for medical interventions where necessary. The enthesis would then be placed on a more holistic, case by case, patient centric approach. By incorporating the social model of disability into his argument, Bergamin could have ended up with a more convincing argument around what constitutes autonomy and necessitates intervention.</p><br>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Effects of Policy and Practice on Early TOMS Shoes</strong></h2>  
            <p>TOMS Shoes launched in May 2006 and immediately became a hit. By October 2008 TOMS was selling $48 canvas Shoes in 400 retail outlets and online. The canvas shoes were modeled off of those TOMS Founder, Blake Mycoskie, found in Argentina. According to “Power Point: Be the change” Patricia Sellers writes that Mycoskies business model was simple, instead of spending 20% of the shoe companies’ gross margin on advertising, they would instead use word of mouth from giving free pairs of shoes to people in Argentina, South Africa, and Ethiopia to get word out about their product (Stellers, 2009).</p> <br>
            <span id="dots1"></span>
            <div id="more1">
            <p>TOMS also sought to use this business model to fulfill an altruistic mission and fulfill a need. In 2011 Blake Mycoskie Wrote a piece in Business Insider titled “Blake Mycoskie Conceived the Idea For TOMS Shoes While Sitting On A Farm, Pondering Life, In Argentina” explaining what his goals for TOMS where at the time. He explains that while meeting a American woman in Argentina running a “shoe drive” that many kids lacked shoes. She argued that this was an issue because it made different aspects of their lives either inconvenient, uncomfortable, or unsafe. Mycoskie states, “[lack of shoes complicated] essentials like attending school and getting water from the local well -- but also exposed them to a wide range of diseases.” And then went on to explain that the shoe drive was hampered by, “Their complete dependence on donations (…) [meaning] that they had little control over their supply of shoes. And even when donations did come in sufficient quantities, they were often not in the correct sizes, which meant that many of the children were left barefoot even after the shoe drop-offs. (Mycoskie, 2011)” Toms main brake through grew out of this experience and exists till this day. As they state on their website “TOMS founder Blake Mycoskie pioneered the One for One® model—giving away one pair of shoes for every pair sold, supporting larger health, education, and community development programs through strategic partnerships. (TOMS, 2024)” </p><br>
            <p>This buy one give one (BOGO) model would arguably fail in part due to structural policies affecting its success. An article in Forbes by David Hessekiel titled “The Rise And Fall Of The Buy-One-Give-One Model At TOMS” outlines what happened with the BOGO model TOMS would be bought up by Bain Capital in 2014, reportedly to avoid filing for bankruptcy. The article points out in the early stages of TOMS, around 2008, they were having issues distributing the volume of shoes needed to fulfill BOGO. Blake Mycoskie stated that “Giving is really hard” it seems apparent that in the early TOMS did not do the due diligence to understand how to implement this scale of program. They later would build out a network of nonprofits to distribute shoes to across different countries. Distribution models verified in effectiveness depending on place and program, but a common criticism is that TOMS hurt footwear manufacturers and distributers in impacted markets (Hessekiel, 2021). </p><br>
            <p>Now let’s look at some examples of where Supply chains issues and atomized government policies did affect the course of early TOMS BOGO program. In “Come To Africa For Business, Not Handouts” Michael Buckler and Beau Jackson from the National Peace Corps Association outline how BOGO affects African Economies. They state that African Countries are sometimes skeptical of social enterprises like TOMS because they bring American business perspectives to African business environments. As of 2012 TOMS had given away 2 million pairs of shoes while only having a pilot local manufacturing program set up in Ethiopia. The vast majority of shoes where not constructed in local markets.  The article also states that the BOGO model inflicts invisible harms on Africans. This is because, “However, successful marketing is the most insidious way in which these organizations inflict harm. When an investment banker returns home from work and sees his child wearing TOMS Shoes, the message is clear—Africa is not ready for my investment money. (…) Surveys of American companies confirm this bias (Buckler & Jackson, 2013, P. 1-2).” TOMS BOGO model is problematic for African countries on multiple levels. </p><br>
            <p>The practice of giving product giving massive amounts of free product to low-income countries is referred to as dumping. As Charles Kenny points out in “Haiti Doesn’t Need Your Old T-Shirt” An organization like the National Football League can dump 100,000 shirts on Nicaragua and Zambia and write it off as a charitable donation and tax break. People in these countries argue that they might not even need to product, because often the need is exaggerated due to cultural misunderstanding or just looking at the worst cases of poverty. Even if they needed the product, it would be better for the economy and environment if they got it from a local distributor rather than a Western NGO that has to ship the product overseas. The article states that programs like the U.S. food aid program air dropped 2.4 million Pop-Tarts on Afghanistan, “the scale of U.S. food aid isn't strongly tied to how much recipient countries actually require it -- but it does rise after a bumper crop in the American heartland, suggesting that food aid is far more about dumping American leftovers than about sending help where help is needed. And just like secondhand clothing, castoff food exports can hurt local economies.” Local rice production declined over the period of time the U.S. food aid program was operating in Haiti. Direct monetary donations to farmers would have been more effective and selfless then distributing US manufactured foods in Haiti. Kenny argues that, “if [TOMS Shoes} consumers are buying Toms instead of donating to charity, as some surely are? Much better to stop giving them the stuff we don't want -- and start giving them the money they do. Kenny (2014)” </p><br>
            <p>In 2016 there was a study done on the TOMS BOGO program in El Salvador. It measured the effect of toms on school aged children and households. They measured the same metrics Blake Mycoskie was trying to address with his original mission, mainly children’s time allocation, school attendance, health, self-esteem, and aid dependency. There was found to be a correlation between shoe access and time doing outdoor activities but insignificant impacts on all other metrics. The program negatively impacted dependency. This study is another example of the murky impact of this kind of BOGO in-kind donation programs (Wydick et al., 2016, P. 727). The study points out that the success of the TOMS program is very contextual and may be more effective in countries that are lower income and lack shoe access (Wydick et al., 2016, P. 747-749). Ultimately TOMS probably would have been more successful from a philanthropic perspective if they had chosen to use a business model other than BOGO. In essence, the TOMS BOGO program's impact, as highlighted by this study in El Salvador, reveals the complexities of aid initiatives and prompts a reconsideration of strategies that could more effectively address global social challenges.</p><br>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Impact of Home Energy Scores on Cities</strong></h2>
    <P>Many Oregon Cities have set ambitious targets for lowering their carbon footprints in recent years. In Portland they set the goal of lowering carbon emissions by 50 percent compared to emissions set in the year 1990. By 2050 they want to be net-zero meaning the amount of greenhouse gases emitted is equal to the amount removed by carbon sinks (City of Portland, 2024). Other cities like Hillsboro are more detailed. Hillsboro wants 80% of the cities greenhouse gas emissions compared to a 2007 baseline with the rest being offset (City of Hillsboro, 2019). One of the policies both cities have tried in pursuit of that effort is a home energy score policy. The US Department of energy has found that 21% of energy consumption comes from residential homes. 15% of greenhouse gas emissions also come from the same source (U.S. Department of Energy, 2021).</P> <br>
    <span id="dots3">...</span>
    <div id="more3">   <p>Home energy scores are a tool to help cities address this problem. They are assessments mandated by cities before a home is sold. In cities like Portland and Hillsboro it follows guidelines set forth by the US Department of Energy Scoring energy efficiency on a scale from 1-10. 10 would mean a very energy efficient building and 1 would mean significant room for improvement. The Average home has a score of 5. Home Energy Score system score sheet also outlines how much carbon the home is responsible for and what the homeowner would save if they improved their energy efficiency. It then has recommendations and improvements for things that could be done to improve the score (City of Hillsboro, 2020). This policy is a huge win for the consumer and cities. Home Energy Score Policies guaranty home buyers the right to know the energy efficiency of their home just like they know the fuel efficiency of their car. It is a win for the low-income individual because they may avoid a long-term cost burden of inefficient energy usage. We could also offset or eliminate the up-front costs for an upgrade depending on what types of financial aid or programs from non-profits like the Energy Trust of Oregon (Energy Trust of Oregon, 2024). Today we are going to go into further detail about the impact of a home energy score and by analyzing the problem, looking at case studies in Oregon from cities like Portland, analyze impacts and criticism, and talk about the next steps for advancing home energy score programs in cities. </p><br>
    The City of Portland has a massive housing market comprising more then 20,000 homes (City of Portland, 2020). We already know that lots of housing is not very energy efficient and it is a considerable contributor to greenhouse gasses for cities. When proposing the Home Energy Score policy to city council the city of Portland commissioned a report looking at the impact of a scoring policy. They pointed to the Regional Building Stock Assessment in western Oregon as a blueprint for their own home energy score. The Home Energy Score (HES) data helps stakeholders like nonprofits, energy organizations, and researchers improve energy efficiency, assist low-income households, and track carbon reduction progress. Many Portland homes have low energy efficiency, with outdated heating systems and little insulation, presenting significant opportunities for upgrades. If recommended upgrades with a 10-year payback were made, carbon savings would equal powering 2,541 homes annually. Their where 2 main issues they were trying to address (City of Portland, 2020). Much like how Zillow has walkability scores consumers deserve the right to understand their homes energy efficiency a considerable cost and operating in the home before purchase. The total cost of a home energy score in Portland settled to around $125.00 with a means tested low-income program applied to home sellers operating in areas with low area median income. The program in Portland received positive reviews from home buyers because it increased transparency when surveyed. Though there was a marginal cost associated with implementing the home energy score the intangible costs to home buyers along with long term tenure costs more than offset both the upfront cost of the home energy score assessment and the cost to install energy efficient upgrades to a home. In fact, a plurality of homes in Portland received a score of 1 meaning much room for improvement but when applying the recommended improvements in the home energy score the average home receives an 8. This is because some homes art equipped to become completely energy efficient (City of Portland, 2020). The report found that the most common recommended home energy score improvements were ceiling gaps in windows sealing ducts, upgrading the water heater and heat pump and insulating walls (City of Portland, 2020). Addressing higher energy bills that burden low-income consumers and environmental issues associated with climate change like the urban heat island effect are the main reasons to undergo the policy. </p><br>
    There are some major criticisms and negative externalities associated with home energy score policies. High upfront costs and reluctance to take on debt hinder homeowners from upgrading, though incentives from the Energy Trust of Oregon aim to address this. HES compliance has improved through education and enforcement, though challenges remain in reaching vulnerable communities and achieving higher compliance rates. HES contributes to Portland’s climate goals, but further efforts are needed to decarbonize all buildings and protect at-risk communities. The report also points out that commercial buildings are a bigger issue in Portland then single family homes and suggests department resources should be pushed in that direction. Home sellers pay the price for the score, and it is assumed pass the cost off to consumers during the sale of the home. This might make a HES policy a tough sell when housing costs are high or among the real estate industry (City of Portland, 2020). A report by the US Department of Energy found only small disparities in the predictive power of home energy scores following different guidelines. The report looked at 2 different ways of calculating home energy scores, one of which being HEScore which is the US Department of Energy’s scoring model. Results show that the effect of whole-house leakage on energy use is small, whether estimated through qualitative input or a blower door test. Comparing energy use predictions from these two methods revealed only a 2-3% difference on average, with most homes scoring within one bin of each other. The study found that the qualitative input (sealed vs. unsealed) had a minimal impact on energy predictions, and overall, the HEScore model accurately estimates energy use even without a blower door test. The results suggest that the HEScore's algorithm, which includes factors like home age and size, provides a reliable estimate of energy use and is suitable for cases where blower door tests are not available (Merket & Heaney, 2014). </p><br>
    The main negative externality associated with home energy scores and levied by critics is that it leads to unnecessary cost burden placed on the home seller and then passed on to the buyer. A Study conducted in 2024 titled “How Does Mandatory Energy Efficiency Disclosure Affect Housing Prices?” looked to answer this question. In homes, sellers may know more about energy efficiency than buyers, which can affect pricing. An energy efficiency audit policy could help address this by making energy efficiency more noticeable to buyers, which could influence their decisions. The study defined the term Salience, a concept where certain factors get more attention in decision-making, plays a role here. For example, buyers may not initially focus on energy efficiency, but when prompted by realtors, they might consider it more. This could raise prices for energy-efficient homes. The study suggests that energy efficiency policies may encourage long-term investment in energy efficiency by increasing awareness, benefiting both the environment and consumer decisions. Additionally, such policies could help buyers more easily find homes that match their preferences for energy efficiency (Cassidy, 2024). Basically, the report suggests that the main positive externality outside of price is that thou homeowners already have a general sense of their home’s energy efficiency having a mandated audit increases the salience of the issue for the buyer. This decreases the likelihood that an omitted variable in a home buyer's purchase decision could impact home value. This study however does not conclude that home energy scores make it more likely 4 energy upgrades to happen only that a home with a positive home energy score has a positive correlation with housing price (Cassidy, 2024), </p><br>
    Portland and Hillsboro use the Home Energy Score to assess home energy efficiency, helping buyers understand energy costs. Homes are rated from 1 to 10, with recommendations for improvements. The program supports climate goals but faces challenges like high upfront costs and compliance issues. Critics argue the cost burden is passed to buyers, potentially raising home prices. However, it increases awareness of energy efficiency and supports long-term environmental goals. Programs like home energy scores are only present in some cities in the state. A great next step for this environmental policy might be creating a larger statewide framework for home energy scores in Oregon cities. Mandating a home energy score could prevent a race to the bottom where Realtors are less likely to operate in urban areas where the score is present due to cost or time burden. The policy creates a market-based mechanism to counter climate change in cities. There's a need for a larger call to action from the state to create compliance in all cities and give smaller or marginalized communities a chance to benefit from the program. </p><br>
